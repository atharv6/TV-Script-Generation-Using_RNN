## TV-Script-Generation-Using_RNN
Seinfield Tv show Script Generation using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

# Project Overview
In this project, I generated my own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. I used a part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network i built generates a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

# Recurrent Neural Networks
Recurrent Neural Network is a generalization of feedforward neural network that has an internal memory. RNN is recurrent in nature as it performs the same function for every input of data while the output of the current input depends on the past one computation. After producing the output, it is copied and sent back into the recurrent network. For making a decision, it considers the current input and the output that it has learned from the previous input.

# Setup
This project requires GPU acceleration to run efficiently. Support is available to use either of the following two methods for accessing GPU-enabled cloud computing resources.

# Result
The TV Script generated and have similar characteristics to the original tv scripts, the results are pretty fun! The following TV script was generated:

jerry: serial beep.

elaine: so, i signed up with a cop and he pretended he says" hey" so what?

elaine: oh, yeah, i got news from the other side of the dryer.

jerry: what happened?

jerry: i think it would be a little effeminate.

jerry: what?

george: yes.

peterman: yes.

jerry: yeah, yeah.

newman: well, that's not easy. it's moors.

elaine: well, i'm not getting married to get back to the library show, and inconsequential for a year.

elaine: what? why didn't you just put a nap on?

george: yeah. yeah. i forgot to replace that.

elaine: i know... liking he killed me for a while.

jerry: i don't want it.

peterman: so i guess i'll see you later.

peterman: so you want to buy it?

george: i thought we were going to get that jet.

hoyt: and we are burning. it's moors, it's a misprint.

kramer: oh, yeah. well, that's the gist of my name.

jerry: i can't find it!

peterman: well, it's not easy.

george: i can't.

george: you know, the basic law has been abused, huh?

jerry: yeah.

elaine: i guess we could get rid of the way to the stand of the night forth pursuit.

george: i can't.

kramer: well, i think we can handle it.

george: i don't know, but i was screamin' in the middle of my breasts and a cup of trivial pursuit.

kramer: oh, yeah.

elaine: well, i'm gonna have to get some kind of thought that i had it with you, too much.

george: oh.

george: oh, hi.

newman: hey jerry, you know, i think it would be the emergency.
